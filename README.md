# Anonymous Analytics

Anonymous Analytics is an analytics service targeting game developers to collect and analyze data with their own choices. Unlike existing analytics services on the market that automatically collecting user privacy data, developers have full control over which data to be sent and stored in Anonymous Analytics.

## Features

- A web service with a set of well-defined REST APIs to send and store data
- An evolving user-friendly webpage to show aggregated data by charts
- A management portal to organize data under different projects.
- Self-hosting or cloud-hosting web service in minutes

The team also plans to support client SDKs that can be integrated into mainstream game engines.
